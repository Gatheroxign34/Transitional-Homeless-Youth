        <p> This project explores this question using U.S. Housing and Urban Development data with Salesforce Tableau </p>
        <p> Inquiry: Selected HUD homeless shelter datasets to discover patterns in pandemic-era homeless youth migration.</p> 
        <p> Methods & Tools: Added Tableau dimension filters and created calculated fields to hand-pick, clean and organize key total 
            percent youth bed data points for analysis. In the final Tableau dashboard, instituted a tri-color legend for bubble 
            charts, ascending scatterplots, and column charts to show changes in percent of available beds for the years 2018, 2019 
            and 2020.</p>
        <p> Analysis: Determined that the Covid-19 pandemic created significant changes in available beds for transitional homeless 
            youth inshelters in the U.S. and New York from 2019-2020. </p>
        <p> Recommendation: Review the implications of nationwide homeless youth migration patterns as they affect the changing 
            quantity of housing resources needed in each U.S. state. </p>
